## How to use





In your project directory, run:
```
npx autoheal
```

Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo or GTP-4 APIs. [Requires OpenAI API key.](https://beta.openai.com/)

<br/>

## How well does it work?

This depends on many factors, including the size and structure of your project and the quality of your tests. In general, it works best on projects will smaller files. Using GPT-4 is much more reliable than GPT-3.5-turbo, but it is also much more expensive (as of April 2023)
